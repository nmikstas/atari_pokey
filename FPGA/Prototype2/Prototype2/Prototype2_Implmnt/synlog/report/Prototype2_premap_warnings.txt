@W: BN132 :"d:\work\arcade+projects\atari_pokey\hdl\verilog\source\ser_core.v":211:4:211:9|Removing sequential instance _ser_core.preBCLK because it is equivalent to instance _ser_core.presdi. To keep the instance, apply constraint syn_preserve=1 on the instance.
@W: MT529 :"d:\work\arcade+projects\atari_pokey\fpga\prototype2\prototype2\pokey_top.v":125:4:125:9|Found inferred clock POKEY_Top|clk179 which controls 18 sequential elements including Dataw[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
